This is our version of the DTTR in the following paper:DTTR: Encoding and decoding monthly runoff prediction model based on deep temporal attention convolution and multimodal fusion. 
The paper is currently being published and a link to it will be included later. Thank you for your interest in our work. I will release more elegant code in future versions.
The code main.py contains the various parts of the DTTR model, please check the introduction of the related paper for details.
